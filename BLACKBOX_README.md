# BLACKBOX

This repository contains the code for the BLACKBOX project. BLACKBOX is a tool for generating adversarial examples for machine learning models.

## Installation

To install BLACKBOX, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed. You can install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, you can install BLACKBOX by running the following command:

```
pip install blackbox
```

## Usage

To use BLACKBOX, you will need to create a `blackbox.Config` object. This object specifies the parameters of the attack, such as the model to attack, the type of attack to use, and the number of iterations to run.

Once you have created a `blackbox.Config` object, you can use the `blackbox.attack` function to generate adversarial examples. The `blackbox.attack` function takes the following arguments:

* `model`: The model to attack.
* `config`: The attack configuration.
* `input`: The input to the model.

The `blackbox.attack` function returns a list of adversarial examples.

## Examples

The following example shows how to use BLACKBOX to generate adversarial examples for a simple image classification model.

```python
import blackbox

# Create a config object.
config = blackbox.Config()
config.model = "mnist"
config.attack_type = "fgsm"
config.num_iterations = 10

# Load an image.
image = blackbox.load_image("data/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte")[0]

# Generate adversarial examples.
adversarial_examples = blackbox.attack(model, config, image)

# Print the adversarial examples.
for adversarial_example in adversarial_examples:
    print(adversarial_example)
```

The output of the above code will be a list of adversarial examples, each of which is a numpy array representing an image.
